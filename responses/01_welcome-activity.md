## Configuring a workflow

Actions are enabled on your repository by default, but we still have to tell our repository to use them. We do this by creating a workflow file in our repository.

A **workflow** file can be thought of as the recipe for automating a task. They house the start to finish instructions, in the form of `jobs` and `steps`, for what should happen based on specific triggers.

These individual steps take one of two forms.

- Run a raw command such as `echo` or `npm install`
- Use an action such as the one we will be building
