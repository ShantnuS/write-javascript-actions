## Time to code ðŸ’»

You may have noticed that your workflow has been running every time a change has been made.  This is expected since it's trigger is a `push` event.

Hopefully you have also noticed that it fails when it reaches the `hello-action` step.

As we can see from the screenshot, as well as the [Actions]({{actionsUrl}}) tab, the failure occurs because the runner cannot find the action.  

Lets fix that by creating the action it is looking for!

### :keyboard: Activity: Hello World

ðŸ’¡All of the following steps take place inside of the `.github/actions/hello-world` directory. 

The first iteration of our action will follow the traditional path of logging "Hello World" ðŸ‘‹to the console.  We will expand on this as we move forward, for now it's a good test to make sure all of our files are set up correctly ðŸ˜„

1. Create a file named `main.js`
2. Log "Hello World" to the console
    <details><summary>View the complete file</summary>

    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello World")
    ```
    </details>


3. Save the `main.js` file
4. commit the changes:
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m 'create main.js'`
5. push them to the `hello-world` branch:
   `git push`

I'll respond here once the workflow has completed running.  Remember, you need to **push** your changes to trigger it!
