Follow these steps to ensure your local environment is configured and ready for Actions.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
4. Create a new branch named `hello-world`
5. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`
6. Use `git checkout hello-wolrd` to change to the newly created branch
7. Initialize the a new project with `npm init -y`
8. Install the **core** and **github** dependencies from the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) by typing `npm install --save @actions/core @actions/github`
9. Commit those newly added files, including `node_modules`, we will remove the need to upload `node_modules` in a later step
10. Push you changes to your repository
11. Create a new pull request from the `hello-world` branch to `master` with the title of `Hello Actions`
    - Take notice that the pull request name `Hello Actions` is case-sensitive

I will close this issue and continue responding to you in the `hello-actions` pull request once you have created it.
