## Using input parameters

Earlier I asked you to install the `@actions/core` package using `npm`.  We did this so that we can expand our Action to make it more flexible.

A "Hello World" message is great, but let's personalize it a little bit.  We will do this by adding an **input** parameter to the `action.yml` and `main.js` files.

Although this example may seem a little lightweight input parameters have a very flexible use case.  Consider a scenario where you need to access secret API key with your Action, or when you need to specify the path to a given file.  Inputs allows for these problems to be easily solved.

#### A quick example

To add inputs we need to add the `inputs:` parameter to the `action.yml` file.  The `inputs:` parameter has a few parameters of its own.  Let's look at those before seeing how it fits into the `action.yml` file.

**input parameter**

The structure of an input looks like this

The above examples shows that we can have more than one input for our Action, as well as drop any optional parameters we may not need, such as setting a `default:` value for the input parameter.

Let's take a look at how this fits into an `action.yml` file.

**action.yml**

The placement of your `inputs:` is not strictly enforced, however it has become commonplace to ensure the `runs:` statement is defined after your `inputs:` and `outputs:` in your `action.yml` file.

For our case, adding `inputs:` directly after the `description:` will work just fine ðŸ˜„

So what is actually happening here?  Well, in the `my-workflow.yml` file we could specify values for inputs named:

- first-greeting
- second-greeting
- third-greeting

Or we could leave them out and rely on their default values.  The example below demonstrates a mix of both:

**my-workflow.yml**

And in our `main.js` file we would need to account for the inputs that are now a part of the Actions metadata.

By using `getInput()` we can specify the string of any input parameter we have placed inside of the `action.yml` file.

The `@actions/core` package brings a few more methods along with it to help us interact with the Actions platform.  If writing Actions is something you plan to continue doing it's work reading the [documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/core) about this package.
