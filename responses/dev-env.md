## On to your development environment

@{{user.login}} our JavaScript Actions are going to leverage the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) for developing GitHub Actions.

This is an external library that we will install using `npm` which means that you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

I find writing Actions to be easier from a local environment vs trying to do everything right here in the repository.  Doing these steps locally allows you to use the editor of your choice so that you have all the extensions and snippets you are used to when writing code.

If you do not have a preferred environment then I suggest following along with me exactly as you see on the screen, which means you'll need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
