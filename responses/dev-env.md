## On to your development environment

@{{user.login}} our JavaScript Actions are going to leverage the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) for developing GitHub Actions.

This is an external library that we will install using `npm` which means that you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

I find writing Actions to be easier from a local environment vs trying to do everything right here in the repository.  Doing these steps locally allows you to use the editor of your choice so that you have all the extensions and snippets you are used to when writing code.

If you do not have a preferred environment then I suggest following along with me exactly as you see on the screen, which means you'll need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Don't forget to set up your workstation ðŸ˜‰

Most of your work going forward will take place away from your Learning Lab repository, so before continuing with the course ensure you have the following installed on your **local machine**.  

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your editor of choice
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


### :keyboard: Activity: Configure your environment

Now that you have all the necessary tools installed locally, follow these steps to ensure your environment is configured and ready for Actions.

1. Open the **Terminal** (Mac and Linux) or **Command Prompt** (Windows) on your local machine
2. Clone your Learning Lab repo to your local machine:
   `git clone https://{{repoUrl}}.git`

3. Navigate to the folder you just cloned:
   `cd writing-javacript-actions`

    <!-- ![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/duA6JVCuXbt5gKqNLw/giphy.gif) -->
4. Create a new branch named `hello-world`.  This is the branch we will use to write our first Action.  **Please do not capitalize letters unless I do, I run case-sensitive checks to make sure I can help you along the way!**
   `git checkout -b hello-world`

5. Create a new folder for our Actions files:
   `mkdir -p .github/actions/hello-world`
6. Navigate to the `hello-world` folder you just created:
   `cd .github/actions/hello-world`
7. Initialize the a new project with `npm init -y`
8. Install the **core** and **github** dependencies from the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) by typing `npm install --save @actions/core @actions/github`
9.  Commit those newly added files, including `node_modules`, we will remove the need to upload `node_modules` in a later step
10. Push you changes to your repository:
    `git push -u origin hello-world`
11. Create a new pull request from the `hello-world` branch to `master` with the title of `Hello Actions`
    - Take notice that the pull request name `Hello Actions` is case-sensitive

I will close this issue and continue responding to you in the `hello-actions` pull request once you have created it.
