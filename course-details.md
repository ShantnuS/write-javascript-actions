[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful platform that empowers your team to go from code to cloud all from the comfort of your own repositories.

Over the duration of this course, approximately 1 hour, you will learn the skills needed to begin using and customizing GitHub Actions in your unique workflow scenarios.

**Prerequisites**

We will be using Node.js to build our action and GitHub to consume our action. This presents us with a hybrid environment, the Node.js runtime environment and the virtual machine used by GitHub Actions, that you may not be used to if you've taken other Learning Lab courses.

Before we can get started there are a few things you need to setup on your **local machine**:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for your operating system
2. Ensure you have a text editor installed. I'll be using Visual Studio Code, and although you are free to use your editor of choice, you should be aware that using a different editor will result in your screen not matching the examples as provided. The steps will remain the same but the formating and display may vary. Here are some popular editor options:
   1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) **(recommended)**
   2. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   3. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. Lastly, you're going to need a local installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so that you can interact with this repository as you write code.
